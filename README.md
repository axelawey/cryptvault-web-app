Hi, I am cryptvault.! I am a simple project that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using various cryptographic algorithms.
Want to try?
Let's do it!!
Features

    Encryption: Encrypt your messages using advanced cryptographic algorithms.
    Decryption: Decrypt encrypted messages back to their original form.
    Web Interface: Access the app through a user-friendly web interface.
    Python Backend: Built using Python and popular libraries for cryptography.

How to Use

    Open the index.html file in your web browser.
