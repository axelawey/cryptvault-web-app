# cryptvault.

Hi, I am cryptvault.! I am a simple project that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using various cryptographic algorithms. Want to try? Let's do it!!

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt your messages using advanced cryptographic algorithms.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt encrypted messages back to their original form.
- **Web Interface:** Access the app through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Python Backend:** Built using Python and popular libraries for cryptography.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Input data you are looking to encrypt/decrypt.
3. Create a cipher key for encryption/decryption, using any characters you desire.
4. Click on the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button, based on the action you wish to perform.
5. Your result will be displayed in the designated area.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** AES is used for encrypting and decrypting data.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the password generator interface.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for generating random passwords and handling user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- Secure Shell Hashing

Feel free to explore and experiment with different encryption and decryption techniques using cryptvault.!
